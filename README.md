# openscience

This project surveyed researchers in applied behavior analysis to assess their perceptions and use of open science practices, such as data sharing, preregistration, and open access publication. Although respondents generally expressed favorable opinions, reported use of such practices was limited. The study highlights opportunities for increasing transparency and accessibility in behavior analytic research.
